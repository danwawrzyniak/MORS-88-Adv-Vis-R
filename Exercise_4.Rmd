```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6)
```

## Setting up the environment

Load packages

library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(dplyr)

Here is the world city population data. A few italian cities have been selected from it.

```{r}
cities <- world.cities %>% filter(country.etc=="Italy") %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Milan", "Naples", "Bari","Rome", "Venice", "Florence", "Bologna", "Pisa"))
cities
```

## Create a map of Italy


Use ```geom_polygon``` to create the map

```{r}
# Here is the region subsetted
italy <- map_data("world") %>% filter(region=="Italy")
# make the fill color "grey", and add theme_bw



```

## Add the selected cities

```{r}



```


## Scale the cities to the population size
```{r}




```


## Give the captial city a diamond shape

Hint: remember to factor the capital column
```{r}
# Use manual shape values 16 & 18



```
